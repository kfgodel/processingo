##ProcessingO:
Experimental project to approach processing using a more object oriented api

The idea behind this project is to move away from the sketch metaphor used by processing, and at the same time
offer an api that gives you objects to work with and think the processing elements.  

This, of course adds some extra complexity that processing doesn't have. But this complexity will hopefully allow you
to structure your programs when you want to do more than sketches.
It should also help you learn the api by grouping related operations into classes and adding documentation
to the methods (so you can access them as javadoc, o sources)
